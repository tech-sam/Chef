**Chef**
Chef is a data scheduling and normalization service built on [Mix Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html). 
Just like a chef in a restaurant collects raw ingredients and converts them into recipes, Chef fetches data from multiple match providers, normalized it and persists it into the `Postgre database`.
